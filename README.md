# IBM Attrition Analytics using ML Models

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing advanced predictive models to accurately forecast employee burnout using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. The objective is to utilize sophisticated machine learning techniques to enhance HR interventions and improve retention strategies.

## Data Collection
The 'IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance' dataset is available on Kaggle, which contains a wide range of HR metrics such as employee satisfaction, job level, and monthly income.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Main programming language.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** For neural network implementation.

## Repository Structure
- **predictive_modeling.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the predictive modeling code.
- **IBMdata.csv:** File containing the dataset in CSV format.

## How to Run
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed (requirements.txt provides the details).
- Run the Jupyter notebook predictive_modeling.ipynb to execute the analysis from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Models Developed
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Explored various settings through hyperparameter tuning.
- **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):** Optimized with GridSearchCV for best performance.
- **Neural Network:** Configured with multiple layers to effectively capture complex patterns in the dataset.

## Key Findings
The predictive models developed demonstrated high accuracy in identifying factors contributing to employee burnout. Notably, models like Random Forest and GBM outperformed simpler models, providing robust predictions that can inform strategic HR decisions.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the effectiveness of advanced machine learning techniques in understanding and predicting employee burnout, offering valuable insights that can be leveraged to enhance employee retention and satisfaction.
